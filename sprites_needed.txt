List of Sprites I Need (in spritesheet form for those with animations):
- player
	* normal player (like the one I have but with a better walk cycle)
	* ranged version of the player (gun, red/grey motif)
- Enemies
	* All up to you
	* Maybe some lizards
	* crabs
	* of course, slimes
		& slimes need to jump for movement rather than just walking (sliding?)
	* Bosses
		& also up to you
		& haven't decided on any yet
- pickups (put these on one spritesheet)
	* health pickups
	* exp pickups
	* Items
		& I have literally no clue how these are gonna work yet
		& whatever you want
- background
	* Stage 1 for now
- tiles
	* Platforms, ground, etc.
